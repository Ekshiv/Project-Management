# Project-Management

## What is a PROJECT?

- Process is set of task or ongoing with no definitive end while __Project__ is _series of task_ that needs to be completed to _achieve a specific outcome_.

- it has definitive _begining and end_.

- every project is _unique and  one-time activity_ i.e. once you reach the desired outcome then project will be finished.

- it can be managed by _one or multiple person_(Project manager) that depend upon scope of that project.

## What is Project Management?

- Since project is series of task, done to reach desired result, that can only be achieve if we plan and manage those steps ( financial, human, non-human resources ) involved in a project. Project management is planning and managing of a project to achieve listed objectives and deliverables.  

- it includes recognizing and managing risk, carefully resource planning, and pen communnication between team and stakeholders.

### Project Management Life Cycle
Project management life cyle has 5 stages:

1. __Initiation__ - understand the end-goal, priorities(first task, second task, and so on), deadlines(deciding of estimated-time release date), and risk involved.

2. __Planning__ - outline the task involved and timeline for each task. (We try to divide each task and respectively defining its deadline too in this phase)
   
3. __Execution__ - turn plan into action ( Since there is always a difference in what we plan and what we do, and that's what it is ensure in this phase that plan work out in effective and efficient way )

4. __Monitoring__ - tracking the progress of a each task, checking how far we are from goal, and keep tab on budget.

5. __Closing__ - Analyze results and summarise the key learnings. (project may be sucessfull or fail but we learn from it by documenting it and learn key takeaway. So that we can do more better in our next project)

This is how an entire project life cycle moves from __initiation__ to __closing____.


## Why do we __Need__ project management tools?

* Tools not just only __assist the team__ but also __help the individuals__ too complete the task effectively and efficiently.
