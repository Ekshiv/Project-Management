## Basics Of Agile Methodlogy

* Agile is a software development methodlogy that focuses on assisting teams in getting work done by allowing to organize their work.

* Agile calls for collaborative cross-functional teams in which open communication, collaboration, adaptation, and trust amongst team members can cultivate and so that they can bring the best to project the way they know is best.

### Agile Frameworks

1. __Scrum__
 Scrum has a sprint. A sprint is a pre-determined amount of time where teams determine the work to get done. Scrum is built on short and controlled work sprints. Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

2. __Kanban__ 
 Kanban does not have sprint and this framework is more continuous and fluid. Kanban is a popular framework used to implement agile and DevOps software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.

### Key Concept within Jira

* **User Story/ Story:** A brief and simplified explaination of a feature in a system that is currently being developed. This story is conveyed from the viewpoint of user or the person who will utilize the feature.

* __Issues:__ They are the primary unit of work in Jira. They represent tasks, bugs, and other work items that need tracking and managing. Issues can be assigned to individuals or teams with various attributes like priority, status, and due date.

* **Workflows:** They define the lifecycle of an issue, including its status and transitions. Jira has a default workflow, but it can also be customized to match the needs of a specific project.

* **Boards:** They are used to visualize and manage the progress of issues in a project. Jira has three types of boards: Scrum boards, Kanban boards, and Agile boards.

* **Sprints:** Sprints are time-boxed periods of work in Scrum methodology. Sprints help teams to focus on a specific set of tasks and deliverables within a fixed timeframe.

* **Epics:** Epics are large work items that are broken down into smaller issues. They provide a high-level view of the work that needs to be done and help teams to prioritize their work.
